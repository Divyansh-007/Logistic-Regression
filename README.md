# Ads Pop-Up Click
In this project with the use of fake advertising data, we will try to create a Logistic Regression model to predict whether or not a person online will click on an advertisement that pops-up.
Some of the features we would be considering:-
1. Age
2. Daily internet usage
3. Daily time spent on site
4. Ad topic
5. Clicked on Ad or not
